abstract = {The problem of identifying an unknown regular set from examples of its members and nonmembers is addressed. It is assumed that the regular set is presented by a minimally adequate Teacher, which can answer membership queries about the set and can also test a conjecture and indicate whether it is equal to the unknown set and provide a counterexample if not. (A counterexample is a string in the symmetric difference of the correct set and the conjectured set.) A learning algorithm Lâˆ— is described that correctly learns any regular set from any minimally adequate Teacher in time polynomial in the number of states of the minimum dfa for the set and the maximum length of any counterexample provided by the Teacher. It is shown that in a stochastic setting the ability of the Teacher to test conjectures may be replaced by a random sampling oracle, EX( ). A polynomial-time learning algorithm is shown for a particular problem of context-free language identification.}

abstract="We introduce a subclass of non deterministic finite automata (NFA) that we call Residual Finite State Automata (RFSA): a RFSA is a NFA all the states of which define residual languages of the language it recognizes. We prove that for every regular language L, there exists a unique RFSA that recognizes L and which has both a minimal number of states and a maximal number of transitions. Moreover, this canonical RFSA may be exponentially smaller than the equivalent minimal DFA but it also may have the same number of states as the equivalent minimal DFA, even if minimal equivalent NFA are exponentially smaller. We provide an algorithm that computes the canonical RFSA equivalent to a given NFA. We study the complexity of several decision and construction problems linked to the class of RFSA: most of them are PSPACE-complete.",
