\chapter{Implementation}\label{chapter:implementation}

We apply automata learning algorithms to solve the regular model checking problems
as well as finding an inductive statements for regular transition system.

\paragraph*{Membership query}
On a membership oracle, the learner provides a statement and asks the teacher if 
this statement whether inductive or not. As we described in \autoref{chapter:inductive_statement}, 
a statement $I$ is \textit{inductive} if, for any transition $v \rightsquigarrow u$
where $u$ satisfies $I$, $u$ also satisfies the statement.
REF TO ABOVE DEFINITION.
Therefore, one can simply implement the Membership Oracle by checking the acceptance 
of $\mathcal{M}$ while $\mathcal{M}$ is an automaton for 
$\overline{Inductive_{\mathcal{V}}(\mathcal{M})}$ and negating the answer.
